This is the template for Benny's VFX pipeline.
Current support is limited to Maya 2013, H12, and Nuke.

In order to use the pipeline you will need to set some environment variables :

OSX:
Add the following to your PATH

#BENNY VFX PIPELINE VARS
FXPIPEPATH="/Volumes/HDD/bennymuller/git/VFX"
export FXPIPEPATH
NUKE_PATH="$FXPIPEPATH/nuke:${NUKE_PATH}"
export NUKE_PATH
MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH="$FXPIPEPATH/maya:${MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH}"
export MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH
PYTHONPATH="$FXPIPEPATH/python:$FXPIPEPATH/maya:${PYTHONPATH}"
#END



WINDOWS:
Create a batch file with the following entries:


echo -----------------------------------------------------------
REM - this is the location of the root of the vfxpipe folder
set FXPIPEPATH=z:\software\devl_vfxpipe

REM - don't change the following 3 lines
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\python;%FXPIPEPATH%\maya
set NUKE_PATH=%NUKE_PATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\nuke
set MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH=%FXPIPEPATH%\maya

REM - these are optional here
set job=myjob
set seq=sequencename
set shot=0001
REM - end of optional variables

"c:\program files\autodesk\maya2013\bin\maya.exe"


Additionally, the pipeline listens to (and wants!) other variables:
set job=yourjobname
set seq=sequencename
set shot=shotnumber

These variables will allow the system to automatically load Nuke and Maya tools for the show.
look in the fxpipe/__init__.py file for the information you need to modify for your custom setup
